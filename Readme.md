<!-- Problem Statement 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP) -->

Problem: Implement a function to preprocess and tokenize text data. Requirements:

- • Implement in Python using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
- • Handle edge cases such as punctuation, stop words, and different cases. Evaluation Criteria:
- • Correctness of the preprocessing steps.
- • Efficiency and readability of the code.
- • Clean and structured code with appropriate comments.


<!-- Problem Statement 2: Text Generation -->

Problem: Create a basic text generation model using a pre-trained transformer (e.g., GPT-3). Requirements:

- • Use the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- • Generate coherent text based on a given prompt. Evaluation Criteria:
- • Ability to load and use pre-trained models.
- • Quality and coherence of the generated text.
- • Understanding and application of the transformer model.


<!-- Problem Statement 3: Prompt Engineering -->

Problem: Design and evaluate prompts to improve the performance of a given AI model on a specific task (e.g., summarization, question answering). Requirements:

- • Experiment with different prompt designs.
- • Evaluate the effectiveness of each prompt using appropriate metrics. Evaluation Criteria:
- • Creativity and effectiveness of prompt designs.
- • Use of proper evaluation metrics.
- • Clear explanation and documentation of the process and results.


<!-- Problem Statement 4: Data Analysis -->

Problem: Analyze a dataset and generate insights using a combination of descriptive statistics and visualizations. Requirements:

- • Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- • Provide a Jupyter notebook with the analysis and visualizations. Evaluation Criteria:
- • Accuracy and depth of the data analysis.
- • Quality and clarity of the visualizations.
- • Clean and well-documented code.


<!-- Problem Statement 5: Live Coding Session - API Integration -->

Problem: Develop a Python script to integrate with an external API and fetch data based on user input. Requirements:

- • Use the Requests library to make API calls.
- • Handle API responses and errors gracefully.
- • Parse and display the fetched data in a user-friendly format. Evaluation Criteria:
- • Correct implementation of API integration.
- • Handling of different types of API responses and errors.
- • Clean and well-structured code with appropriate comments.
